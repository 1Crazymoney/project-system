The majority of the first release[1] of the project system, will be heavily focused on [feature parity](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Area-Project+System%22+label%3A%22Project+System-Parity%22) with csproj.dll and msvbprj.dll. This ensures there's a seamless upgrade when customers open existing projects in the new project system. Towards the end of the 2.0 release, we'll look at picking off some of the [new features](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Project+System-Need+CPS+feature%22+label%3A%22Project+System-New+Feature%22).
